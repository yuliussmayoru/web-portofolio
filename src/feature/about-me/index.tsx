                "A seasoned professional with a keen interest in programming, I have journeyed from technical support to quality assurance, and now serve as a founding member of an IT company. <br />
                My experience has equipped me with a unique ability to analyze systems, describe business flows, and oversee the software creation process and see problems from a helicopter view and provide the right solutions.
                <br /> <br />I am particularly proud of my contributions to Dimy Teknologi Indonesia, where I have released several products used in restaurants across the country. However, I am not one to rest on my laurels. 
                <br /> <br /> I've finished honing my skills as a frontend developer through the RevoU Fullstack software engineer bootcamp, and I am committed to furthering my education in the IT field. 
                <br />My goal is to leverage my unique combination of skills and experiences to make significant contributions in the field of software engineering as a Fullstack Software Engineer"
